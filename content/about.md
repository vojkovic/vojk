**G'day, I'm Brock. Thanks for stopping by.**

A little about me:

- 🇦🇺 Based in [Perth, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth) - often called *The most isolated city in the world*.
- 🔍 I run [priv.au](https://priv.au) - a fast, global, privacy-respecting metasearch engine.
- 🤖 I build software and infrastructure, my projects can be viewed on [Github](https://github.com/vojkovic).
- 🌐 I operate [AS44354](https://as44354.net), currently peered with 180 networks at 4 IXPs.
- 📡 I’m also an amateur radio operator [VK6PKT](https://www.qrz.com/db/VK6PKT) - my interests are mainly in packet radio.
- 🔑 To send me encrypted mail, here is my [PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=brockv%40tuta.io). I also use this key to sign my Git commits.
- 📬 You can also reach me via [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@vojkovic:matrix.org); I do my best to be responsive.

A fun fact:
- [Did you know you can host a website on a reverse DNS domain?](https://b.4.0.c.7.0.4.1.a.2.ip6.arpa)
