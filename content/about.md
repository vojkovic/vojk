**G'day, I'm Brock. Thanks for stopping by.**

A little about me:

- 🇦🇺 I'm from [Perth, Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth). 'The most isolated city in the world.'
- 🔍 I host [priv.au](https://priv.au), a fast, global, privacy respecting metasearch engine.
- 🤖 In my free time, I enjoy programming. You can view my projects on my [Github](https://github.com/vojkovic).
- 🌐 I'm the owner and operator of [AS44354](https://as44354.net), my personal IPv6-only autonomous system.
- 🦢 I've had some fun playing in CTF competitions. I'm a member of [SwanSec](https://ctftime.org/team/267102).
- 📬 You can also reach me via [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@vojkovic:matrix.org) if that's your thing. I try my best to be available.
- 🔑 To send me encrypted mail, here is my [PGP key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=brockv%40tuta.io). I also use this key to sign my Git commits.
